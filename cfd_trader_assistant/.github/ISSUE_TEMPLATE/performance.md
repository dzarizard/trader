**What performance issue are you experiencing?**
A clear and concise description of the performance problem.

**Type of issue:**
- [ ] Slow execution
- [ ] High memory usage
- [ ] High CPU usage
- [ ] Slow data loading
- [ ] Slow backtesting
- [ ] Slow dashboard loading
- [ ] Other (please describe)

**Current behavior**
Describe the current performance characteristics:
- Execution time: [e.g. 30 seconds for backtest]
- Memory usage: [e.g. 2GB RAM]
- CPU usage: [e.g. 100% CPU]
- Data size: [e.g. 1 year of 5-minute data]

**Expected behavior**
Describe what you expect the performance to be.

**Environment:**
